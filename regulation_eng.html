                        <h2>Regulation of the Permanent Young Group of the Italian Statistical Society (y-SIS)</h2>

                        <h4>Art. 1 - Name and Purpose</h4>
                        <p align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 12pt;">
                            Within the SIS, the Permanent Young Group of the SIS (y-SIS) is established. The group's objectives are:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><p align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 6pt;">
                                To organize and promote activities, schools, and workshops aimed at PhD students, post-docs, and young researchers working in the field of statistics.</p>
                            </li>

                            <li><p align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 6pt;">
                                To encourage training opportunities and dedicated sessions for young statisticians within the institutional events scheduled by the SIS.</p>
                            </li>

                            <li><p align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 6pt;">
                                To facilitate the dissemination of information related to job opportunities, new research topics, and initiatives of interest to young statisticians, both at local, national, and international levels.</p>
                            </li>
                            
                            <li><p align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 6pt;">
                                To create a network that fosters discussions on research topics and/or community interests, the exchange of ideas, and the connection among young researchers in the field of statistics.</p>
                            </li>
                            
                            <li><p align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 6pt;">
                                To serve as a reference point for those at the early stages of their scientific careers in statistics.</p>
                            </li>

                            <li><p align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 6pt;">
                                To be a reference point for young Italians studying and/or working in the field of statistics abroad.</p>
                            </li>
                            
                            <li><p align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 6pt;">
                                To promote the establishment of a network between young statisticians' sections of other European and international statistical societies (e.g., yRSS, j-ISBA, etc.).</p>
                            </li>
                        </ul><br>

                        <h4>Art. 2 - Governing Bodies</h4>
                        <p align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 12pt;">The governing bodies of the permanent group are the Assembly of members and the Executive Board. The Executive Board is an elective body. Its members serve for a two-year term, which can be immediately renewed only once. In the event of an impediment or resignation of one or more members, the candidates with the highest votes among the non-elected will take over, prioritizing younger candidates in case of a tie. If no suitable replacements are available, the Executive Board may continue to function without replacements, provided that at least half of its members remain in office. Specifically:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li><p align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 6pt;">
                                The positions within the Executive Board include the Coordinator and the Board Members, for a total of 5 members. Among the Board Members, excluding the Coordinator, one is appointed as Secretary by the Coordinator.</p>
                            </li>
                            
                            <li><p align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 6pt;">
                                All Executive Board members are elected directly by y-SIS members and serve a two-year term. To ensure continuity, the elections are staggered: three members are elected one year, and the remaining two the following year. The provisional Executive Board, directly appointed by the SIS Executive Council to draft the regulation, establish the group, and initiate its activities, consists of three people (the Coordinator and two members), who serve for the first two years. At the end of their term, they will be replaced according to the procedures outlined above. The first election will take place in November 2013, during which two additional members will be elected to complete the Executive Board. Since their term will last for the 2014-2015 biennium, the staggered election process will be established from the subsequent election onward. Elections are held in November of the year when terms end, and the newly elected positions become effective on January 1 of the following year.</p>
                            </li>
                            
                            <li><p align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 6pt;">
                                Only y-SIS members are eligible to run for election.</p>
                            </li>

                            <li><p align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 6pt;">
                                The Coordinator chairs Executive Board meetings, coordinates the group's activities, and reports directly to the SIS Executive Council, presenting an annual report on y-SIS activities. The Secretary assists the Coordinator in operational aspects, particularly in managing communications within the group and updating the membership list. Additionally, one Board Member, excluding the Secretary, is responsible for maintaining the group's webpage and handling online communications.</p>
                            </li>
                        </ol><br>

                        <h4>Art. 3 - Membership</h4>
                        <p align="justify">Membership in y-SIS is open to ordinary SIS members who are students or have obtained their most recent degree within the last six years. To complete registration, applicants must submit a document proving their student status or that they obtained their last degree no more than six years ago. If an Executive Board member loses eligibility during their term, they may complete their term in office.</p><br>

                        <h4>Art. 4 - Elections</h4>
                        <p align="justify">Members vote to elect the 5 Executive Board members (3 in even years and 2 in odd years). The new Coordinator is appointed from among the Board Members in a dedicated annual assembly. Any y-SIS member with an active membership can run for election. Candidacies must be submitted via email to the electoral commission, composed of two members appointed by the Executive Board, within a 15-day window in the second half of October of the election year. The electoral commission will compile and publish a list of candidates on the group's webpage. After 15 days from the publication of candidacies, in the second half of November, members may cast a single vote by email to the electoral commission or through designated online voting systems. The candidates with the highest number of votes will be elected. In the event of a tie, younger candidates will be preferred.</p><br>

                        <h4>Art. 5 - Financial Aspects</h4>
                        <p align="justify">Membership in the group is free of charge. If the management of funds from other sources of financing becomes necessary, the Secretary will be responsible for their administration and must report annually to the Coordinator.</p><br>

                        <h4>Art. 6 - Amendments to the Regulation</h4>
                        <p align="justify">The group's regulation may be amended by a majority vote in two consecutive Executive Board meetings, held at least two weeks apart.</p>
