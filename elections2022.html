									<h3>Filippo Ascolani</h3>
									<span class="image left"><img src="images/filippo_ascolani.jpg" alt="" /></span>
									<p> 
                    I am a last-year PhD student in Statistics at Bocconi University, under the supervision of Antonio
                    Lijoi and Igor Prünster. My research interests are focused especially on Bayesian nonparametric
                    methodologies for complex data structures, both from a theoretical and methodological perspectives. I am also interested in theory of MCMC methods and their scalability in high dimensional problems.
                    Moreover, I am a member of the BayesLab of the Bocconi Institute for Data Science and Analytics (BIDSA)
                    and of the MIDAS Complex Data Modeling Research Network. I am also a teaching assistant for various Statistics and 
                    Probability courses. For additional information see  <a href="https://filippoascolani.github.io/">my webpage</a>! </p>.
                  During the PhD I had the luck to interact with many students and professors belonging to the Italian statistical
                  community: it has been a very rewarding experience, that determined a personal and academic growth. Therefore, I am 
                  looking forward to contributing myself to such stimulating environment.<br>
                  My PhD experience has been a period of incredible growth, both scientific and personal. A large
                  part of the merit goes to the stimulating Italian research environment and to interaction with peers, 
                  from which I greatly benefited.
                  Therefore I feel an obligation to pay back the community and try to guarantee a similarly
                  positive experience to as more PhD students as possible. In particular, if elected, I would concentrate 
                  on the following two points:
                  - I would try to continue (and possibly expand) the opportunities for young researchers to 
                  present their work, by organizing (online and in presence) dedicated sessions with dedicated
                  awards.
                  - The recent pandemic has eliminated most opportunities of networking in the last two years. I
                  would like to encourage and organize in presence meetings with the goal of merging communities
                  from different universities/research centers.

									<h3>Carlo Cavicchia</h3>
									<span class="image left"><img src="images/CarloCavicchia.jpg" alt="" /></span>
									<p> I am Carlo Cavicchia and I am an Assistant Professor at the Econometric Institute, Erasmus University Rotterdam. In February 2020 I obtained my PhD in Statistics at the Department of Statistical Sciences, Sapienza University of Rome. My research is focused on the methodological and computational aspects of data analysis. The best feeling is when I can use my knowledge to solve practical and real problems. I am currently working on latent variable models, unsupervised classification and model-based composite indicators. At present, I am teaching Data Science for Marketing Analytics at master’s level. For more info about me, see my <a href="https://carlocavicchia.github.io">webpage</a>! </p>

									<h3>Augusto Fasano</h3>
									<span class="image left"><img src="images/veronica_ballerini.jpg" alt="" /></span>
									<p> I am a postdoc at the Department of Statistics, Computer Science and Applications of the University of Florence, 
                    working with Fabrizia Mealli. In 2021 I obtained my Ph.D. in Economic Statistics at Sapienza University of Rome, 
                    supervised by Brunero Liseo. My research interests are varied, going from official statistics to causal inference; 
                    the common thread is the Bayesian approach. I develop methodologies for population size estimation via integration of multiple
                    sources and in the presence of coverage errors. I am particularly devoted to the study of noncentral hypergeometric distributions
                    for not-at-random missing data problems, which have many potential applications in economics and official statistics. 
                    On the causal side, I work on the formalization and implementation of models for causal analysis in randomized clinical
                    trials with noncompliance, social experiments, and socioeconomic observational studies. You can find more info on !

                  Young-SIS has always promoted the exchange of ideas. Unfortunately, Covid restrictions have heavily impacted the activity of the Society.
                    I would be honored to be on the front line in the y-SIS revival. I aim to build a healthy community where collaboration and
                    continuous exchange are the keywords. I aspire to organize a y-SIS conference in the days immediately before the national SIS meeting, 
                    accessible whatever one’s funds’ availability. A young conference would represent the opportunity for us to be protagonists and take 
                    our time to share ideas and find new inspiration. There would be room to organize helpful tutorials for early-stage researchers, 
                    including “what’s important of a cover letter” and “discovering open access databases.” Then, I would push to organize hybrid 
                    thematic events during the year to enforce the connections among y-SIS members and members of young international Societies.

									<h3>Andrea Nigri</h3>
									<span class="image left"><img src="images/AndreaNigri.jpg" alt="" /></span>
									<p> Andrea Nigri is currently a researcher at the University of Foggia.
									He completed his doctoral studies in Statistics at Sapienza, University of Rome, focusing on the projection
									of mortality and the analysis of longevity dynamics.
									Since 2015 he has been working as a biostatistician and co-author of publications in medical journals, in
									2016 he was a research fellow at the Local Health Department of Padua, working on occupational asbestos
									exposure. He also attended the European Doctoral School of Demography held at CPop (University of
									Southern Denmark), in cooperation with the Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research.
									Andrea has been incorporating statistical thinking and Deep Learning methods into solving problems in the
									field of Demography and Economics, especially in the longevity study and its social and health impacts. </p>
