									<h3>Luca Aiello</h3>
									<span class="image left"><img src="images/Luca_Aiello.jpeg" alt="" /></span>
									<p> I am Luca Aiello, currently in the final year of my Ph.D. (XXXVI cycle) in Statistics 
										within the ECOSTAT Ph.D. program at the University of Milano Bicocca. Throughout 
										the course of my doctoral studies, I've had the opportunity of collaborating with 
										several people. Among them there are my supervisor, Lucia Paci, my co-supervisor, 
										Raffaele Argiento, and Sudipto Banerjee, who hosted me during a visiting period at 
										UCLA in the previous academic year. My research focus is centered on Bayesian 
										spatio-temporal models and methods, with a keen interest in environmental statistics 
										and Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques. Over the years, I've also done teaching assistancies 
										in basic statistics courses at Politecnico di Milano, Università Cattolica del 
										Sacro Cuore di Milano, and the University of Bergamo. </p>
                  <p>I'm really excited about this opportunity to get more involved in our community. I've always cared about giving
			  back and using my energy to make a positive impact on the people around me. Having the possibility to run
			  for the Y-SIS board would be a fantastic way for me to do just that. From what I've seen, the academic statistics
			  community has a huge potential. It's a place where ideas can really take off, and I'm very curious about the chance
			  to help the growth I believe the community has. I think we can make it an even more fun and stimulating place to be.
			  Through these years, in the statistics academic environent, I've noticed the diverse talents and perspectives that
			  everyone brings to the table. I believe that joining the Y-SIS board will let me help build an even stronger sense
			  of togetherness. Whether it's setting up cool events, encouraging collaborations, or help networking between different
			  sub-communities, I'm ready to get in there and make things happen. I want to be a voice that represents what we all want
			  and work hard to turn our ideas into reality. Together, we can create an academic statistics community that's not just
			  thriving but also super inspiring for everyone involved.</p>

									<h3>Angela Andreella</h3>
									<span class="image left"><img src="images/Angela_Andreella.jpg" alt="" /></span>
									<p> 
                    I currently hold the position of Assistant Professor (RTD-A) in Social Statistics at the Department 
                    of Economics at the University Ca’ Foscari Venezia. I earned my Ph.D. in Statistical Sciences from the
                    University of Padova in March 2021, investigating novel statistical methods for analyzing neuroscience
                    data. My primary interest lies in applied statistics in various fields, such as social sciences, health
                    sciences, psychology, neuroscience, and medicine, aiming to enhance both domains. My statistical
                    expertise centers on methods that facilitate the understanding and management of high-dimensional data,
                    such as dimension reduction techniques, statistical shape analysis, permutation tests, multiple testing,
                    and selective inference. If you want to know more about me please see <a href="https://angeella.github.io/">my webpage</a>! </p>
                    
                  <p>I am interested in becoming a part of the y-SIS board for several reasons. I strongly believe in y-SIS's 
                    mission to promote the dissemination of statistics, introduce the academic world to students in a fun and 
                    engaging way, and create connections among young researchers in Italy. I am confident that my experiences and 
                    skills can contribute to this mission. I have a great passion for organizing events, adapting to different 
                    situations, creating networks, and sharing ideas, which I believe will come in handy in this role. Moreover, 
                    I see this as an important step in my academic career, as it will allow me to expand my horizons beyond 
                    publishing and teaching.</p>

									<h3>Daniela Cialfi</h3>
									<span class="image left"><img src="images/daniela_cialfi.jpg" alt="" /></span>
									<p> I am Daniela Cialfi and I am a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Studies Gabriele d'Annunzio (Italy) where 
										I also completed my PhD in Economics and Statistics (XXXII cycle) in April 2019.  My research interests regard
										the intersection between mathematical statistics and machine learning, with a particular focus on Bayesian inference.
										In particular, I am working on Bayesian modelling and related computational methods, both exact (Monte Carlo, MCMC and 
										sequential Monte Carlo) and approximate (Variational Inference).  </p>
										<p>I am committed to promoting deeper and richer forms of Inter and Transdisciplinarity work under the scope of a Young SIS approach. I believe that not only Interdisciplinarity is fundamental to understanding Statistics but also that a broad approach to Statistics  can provide meaningful insights for positive and innovative Inter/Transdisciplinary work in different domains. I am also committed to stimulating a broad community of researchers to embrace not only the more restricted notions of statistics thinking but to attend to its wider epistemic implications in terms of the development of more complex modes of thinking. I wish to continue to promote initiatives and debates focused on stimulating the debates and interdisciplinary collaborations in the subject and in the intersection of philosophical reflections and scientific practice.
										Finally, I am committed to promote equality, fair access to opportunities to all and multiculturality within the Society.
										As a cognitive statistiscian experienced in working with groups and human systems I can make a contribution to the Society towards fostering,
										managing and harvesting the creative potential of its own internal complexity and in the interaction with other systems
										(society, policy, scientific communities). 
										I am committed to putting my skills and interests at the service of the Young SIS, towards a more complex,
										diverse Societies capable of establishing fruitful collaborations and to be useful to Science and Society at large.</p>

									<h3>Laura D'Angelo</h3>
									<span class="image left"><img src="images/Laura_Dangelo.jpg" alt="" /></span>
									<p> I am a postdoctoral researcher in Statistics at the Department of Economics, Management, and Statistics
										at the University of Milano-Bicocca, working under the supervision of Prof. Bernardo Nipoti. 
										I received my PhD in Statistics at the University of Padova in 2022, supervised by Prof. Antonio Canale
										(University of Padova) and Prof. Michele Guindani (UCLA). My research interests mainly regard the development
										and application of Bayesian models, with a particular focus on parametric and nonparametric mixture models.
										</p>	
										<p>It is an honor for me to be considered as a prospective board member for y-SIS. As an early-career researcher,
											I believe that meeting other young researchers to share experiences and knowledge is a key element for one's
											personal and work success. I think that young researchers across Italy are displaying remarkable talent and
											innovative ideas. Organizations like y-SIS play a fundamental role in fostering and giving visibility to these
											researchers. During my years as a y-SIS member, I have truly appreciated the various initiatives, conference
											sessions and events that allowed me to be motivated and inspired by such an international and thriving environment.
											In particular, my recent participation at StaTalk really gave me the opportunity to feel the power and strength
											of the connections that these events can support. For these reasons, it would be a pleasure for me to contribute
											to organizing and promoting this kind of initiatives in the coming years.

									<h3>Marco Mingione</h3>
									<span class="image left"><img src="images/Marco_Mingione.jpg" alt="" /></span>
									<p> 
										I am Marco Mingione, and I am an Assistant Professor (RTD-A) at Roma Tre University. 
										My academic journey kicked off at La Sapienza and it was followed by 1 year of research at
										the Institute of Applied Computing "M. Picone" (IAC-CNR), before starting my Ph.D. in 2018. 
										During my postgraduate training, I developed a keen appreciation for Bayesian hierarchical modeling,
										further stimulated by visiting Prof. Sudipto Banerjee for 6 months at UCLA (Los Angeles). Lately,
										my research work has been focused on Hidden Semi-Markov models and Spatio-temporal Hawkes processes. Regardless
										of the field of application, my primary interest is to find highly interpretable solutions to practical problems
										with social implications, without neglecting the computational burden. This goes alongside the vital role that the
										statistician plays today in improving public awareness of science, and I wish our young community could be the one
										driving toward that goal. </p>
										<p>After years of avidly watching the board's actions and actively engaging in Y-SIS initiatives, I believe it is
											time to pay it back to the community of young statisticians, and join the board as a member. In these
											last years, I have become aware of the significance of collaboration, mentorship, and continuous learning
											within our vibrant statistical community. If given the honor of serving on the board, I am committed to
											fostering a culture of inclusivity, and active participation among young statisticians. In particular,
											I envision creating platforms for knowledge exchange and networking opportunities to nurture the growth
											of our emerging talents. Indeed, by facilitating workshops, seminars, and interactive events, we can promote
											a sense of unity and shared purpose among our members. Leveraging my experience, I wish I could continue
											the great work started from the previous board, and help our society grow. Regardless the outcome, I remain sincerely yours</p>
