									<h3>Gaia Bertarelli (2018-2020) - Coordinator</h3>
									<span class="image left"><img src="images/Bertarelli.jpg" alt="" width="304"/></span>
									<p>My name is Gaia Bertarelli and I'm currently a Post-doctoral Research Fellow at the Department of Economics and Management of the University of Pisa. I recived the Ph.D. degree in Statistics (XXVIII°cycle) from the University of Milano-Bicocca, under the main supervision of Prof. M. Giovanna Ranalli (University of Perugia). After about two years working outside the Academia, I enrolled in the Ph.D. program in Statistics because I missed studying and having fun with data. My main research interests lie in survey sampling, unplanned domain estimation, mixture and latent variable models. More recently, I have become interested in developing new statistical methods for the integration of data from different sources. Since 2015, I have been collaborating with ISTAT in research projects aimed at the methodological development of techniques used in the Institute, because I really believe in the power of Official Statistics in the growth-process of a country. I'm also interested in gender statistics as I believe that statistics has the duty to "fight" injustices and inequalities, too. You can find something more about me  <a href="https://people.unipi.it/gaia_bertarelli/">in my webpage</a></p>

									<h3>Leonardo Egidi (2018-2020) - Secretary </h3>
									<span class="image left"><img src="images/Egidi.jpg" alt="" width="304"/></span>
									<p>I am Leonardo Egidi and I am currently working as postdoctoral  researcher at the Department of Business, Economics, Mathematics and  Statistics "Bruno de Finetti" of the University of Trieste. I got my  PhD in Statistics at the Department of Statistical Sciences of the  University of Padova in March 2018 with a thesis entitled  "Developments in Bayesian Hierarchical Models and Prior Specification  with Application to Analysis of Soccer Data". My research focuses on  mixture models, prior specification, clustering methods and R package  developement. Given my interest for sports, and football in  particular, I enjoy in developing models for football data, and this  gave me the opportunity to become a member of the AUEB Sports Analytics Group (University of Athens). I am currently teaching  Statistical Methods to master's students. When I am not involved in  Statistics, I am used to take the guitar and produce a mixture of noise and words. See <a href="https://www.leonardoegidi.com/">my webpage</a>.</p>

									<h3>Alessia Caponera (2018-2020) </h3>
									<span class="image left"><img src="images/Caponera.jpg" alt="" width="304"/></span>
									<p>My name is Alessia Caponera and I am currently a Postdoctoral Researcher at the Department of Mathematics, University of Rome Tor Vergata, in the research team of Prof. Domenico Marinucci. I received my Ph.D. in Statistics from the Department of Statistical Sciences, Sapienza University of Rome, in February 2020. I graduated in Statistics in 2016 after completing a double degree program managed by Sapienza University and Université Paris Dauphine. I am mostly interested in space-time spherical random fields and related topics, such as spectral representations, spherical wavelets and needlets, functional data analysis on the sphere. I also appreciate teaching Statistics and any form of knowledge sharing.</p>

									<h3>Christian Capezza (2019-2021)</h3>
									<span class="image left"><img src="images/ChristianCapezza.jpg" alt="" width="304"/></span>
									<p> I am a PhD Student in Industrial Engineering at the University of Naples Federico II (XXXII cycle). I am working under the supervision of Biagio Palumbo and Antonio Lepore. I graduated in 2016 in Engineering Management at the same University. My research interests regard analysis of big and complex data in engineering fields. I am currently working on functional data analysis for ship fuel consumption monitoring and generalized additive models for electricity demand forecasting with smart meter data. During the academic year 2017-18 I was visiting student at the Department of Statistical Sciences of the University of Padova. Moreover, in March-September 2019 I have been visiting postgraduate research student at the School of Mathematics of the University of Bristol, where I worked with Matteo Fasiolo and Simon N. Wood on generalized additive models. </p>

									<h3>Emanuele Aliverti (2019-2021)</h3>
									<span class="image left"><img src="images/EmanueleAliverti.jpg" alt="" width="304"/></span>
									<p> I am Emanuele Aliverti and I'm a post-doc at the Department of Statistical Sciences, University of Padova. The focus of my research is on developing and applying statistical methods for complex data. My main interests are scalable Bayesian inference and computational method to perform inference on rich dependence structures (e.g. tensors, networks, large contingency tables).
